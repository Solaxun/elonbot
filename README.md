# elonbot
This is a mostly complete toy version of a bot to buy Dogecoin when Elon tweets about it.  That trade was actually profitable (depending on your exit strategy) for a while, but it has since run it's course.  Since I don't think I will be making money off of it any time soon, I'm sharing it here for future reference or for anybody who might be interested in seeing how a simple bot like this could work.

You must have a `secrets.json` file with Binance and Twitter API Keys in the same directory as the main file.
